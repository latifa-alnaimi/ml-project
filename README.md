# Applied Machine Learning Project
## Machine learning project for prediction of English and Arabic sentiments on Twitter

*Full project can be viewed in the Jupyter notebook file `project_alnaimi.html`*

For this project, I trial supervised machine learning classifiers for the prediction of tweets representing sentiments that were supportive or condemning towards public displays of feminism or women's rights activism. I focus on tweets that were responses to a woman declaring her liberation through twitter when she sought asylum after leaving an oppressive environment. She publicly disclosed her name and picture, which garnered wide array of responses. This is my training data. I use this data to build a model to classify supportive and condemning sentiments.
